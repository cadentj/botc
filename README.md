# Blood on the Clocktower

A simple version of BOTC for in person gatherings. For a fully featured online version, check out [clocktower.online](https://clocktower.online/).

Features: 
- Expansions: Only Trouble Brewing at the moment.
- Multiplayer: Create a lobby as a storyteller and select a handful of characters. Share the code with players to distribute roles.
- All the storytelling necessities:
  - Helper cards, e.g. "These characters are not in play".
  - Svelte Flow for managing character / status tokens on an open canvas.
  - Night order lists, filtered by active roles.
  - Player names instantly associated with tokens in the grimoire so you don't have to collect tokens.
 
To make the in person experience more engaging, I purposely omit actions like voting from the game.
